Hi,

This experience was created to demonstrate my understanding of advanced graphics processing
and included creating a virtual pub that can be explored using a perspective camera.

To launch the projectL a python local server must be started opening index.html (only tested using Google Chrome)

Controls for the software:
    Look: MOUSE
    Zoom: SCROLL WHEEL
    Move: W-A-S-D or ARROWS
    Increase Height: SPACE
    Decrease Height: LEFT SHIFT
    Back Out: ESC
